-   the  middle man or lady is actually very important in computer-land.
-   在电脑领域，中间人是非常重要的一环
-   you see, the software that you use  
-   就像你使用的那样
-   can be thought of as aclub sandwich-like STACK of different programs
-   是由三明治一样一层层的程序堆叠起来的
-   some of which sit BETWEEN whatever program you’re interacting with directly and the hardware itself
-   有些在中间   一边是你可以直接交互的程序  另一边是硬件本身
-   because without THESE layers, programmers and deve;opers would have to code differently for EVERY SINGLE hardware cofiguration on the plant.
-   因为没有这些夹层，程序员和开发者就要给地球上每一个不同的硬件配置编写不同的代码了
-   So, for protecting the apes in the crowd, it is necessary.
-   所以，为了保护人群中的猿类，API 是必要的
-   Other layers sit between two different pieces of OTHER software and help them talk to each other without needing to have tons of code in common.
-   还有一种就是夹在程序中间来帮助他们相互沟通，而不需要重复写一大堆代码
-   By API, that programs can interface with lots of different StTUFF easily.
-   通过API，程序就能轻松调用各种不同的东西了
