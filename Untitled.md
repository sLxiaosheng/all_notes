-   the  middle man or lady is actually very important in computer-land.
-   在电脑领域，中间人是非常重要的一环
-   you see, the software that you use  
-   就像你使用的那样
-   can be thought of as aclub sandwich-like STACK of different programs
-   是由三明治一样一层层的程序堆叠起来的
-   some of which sit BETWEEN whatever program you’re interacting with directly and the hardware itself
-   有些在中间   一边是你可以直接交互的程序  另一边是硬件本身
-   because without THESE layers, programmers and deve;opers would have to code differently for EVERY SINGLE hardware cofiguration on the plant.
-   因为没有这些夹层，程序员和开发者就要给地球上每一个不同的硬件配置编写不同的代码了
-   So, for protecting the apes in the crowd, it is necessary.
-   所以，为了保护人群中的猿类，API 是必要的
-   Other layers sit between two different pieces of OTHER software and help them talk to each other without needing to have tons of code in common.
-   还有一种就是夹在程序中间来帮助他们相互沟通，而不需要重复写一大堆代码
-   By API, that programs can interface with lots of different StTUFF easily.
-   通过API，程序就能轻松调用各种不同的东西了
-   you might be most familiar with a layer called a DEVICE DRIVER, it can “translates” program instructions and talks directly to your hardware
-   你一定对硬件驱动很熟悉吧，它能翻译程序的指令 然后直接传达给你的硬件
-   another layer called an application programming interface, or API
-   另一层叫做应用程序编程接口，或者叫API
-   But if a driver is already there then to serve as the link between your hardware and programs, then what does the APO actually do?
-   但是如果已经由硬件驱动来连接你的硬件和程序，那么API 是做什么的呢
-   Well, think of it like this,  Windows Mac OS and Linux all provide a GRAPHICAL INTERFACE your buttons, checkboxes, menus, etc that are easy to click on.
-   我们来这么看， Windows Mac OS 还有 Linux  都提供一个图形接口（界面）来提供按钮 复选框 菜单这些东西供你点击
-   Without that, you`d be left tediously typing commands for everything you want to do, like back in the days when DOS ruled the world.
-   没有这个 你就只能不断输入指令来完成所有事, 就像当年DOS统治世界的时候，和今天的BASH一样
-   So, an API provides a simpler way for developers to interact with other kinds of softwaree
-   所以，API提供了更简单的方法方便开发者和其他的程序交互
-   a really good example of this is social media plugins you see on certain websites，such as a news arfticle that embeds weibo，these social media giants like QQ, twitter, facebook have their own APIs that they make available to web developers making it easy for them to bake their features into the pages.
-   一个很好的例子就是你在一些网站上能看见社交媒体的插件，就像是一篇新闻中嵌入了微博，这些社交巨头例如都有各自的API供网页开发者调用，让开发者能够在页面上集成它们的功能
-   Without these APIs，these social media giants would have to share code directly with owners of other sites which would be tedious，dificult，and possibly give away certain trade secrets！
-   没有这些API,   这些社交媒体巨头就不得不直接和别的网站共享源代码，又麻烦又困难还有可能泄露商业机密！
-   But if you`re a PC gamer,  you might be even more familiar with GRAPHICS APIS，which sit between the ENGINE of whatever game you're playing and your graphics card driver.
-   如果你是电脑玩家，你们可能对图形API更熟悉，他们夹在你玩的游戏的引擎和你的显卡驱动之间
-   These APIs make it easier for game developers to code cool effects that bring your favorite characters and stories to life，and have them work regardless of whether you have an AMD OF NVIDIA GPU，since the API can talk to any mainstream graphics card.
-   这些API方便游戏开发者编写酷炫的特效，生动地描绘你最喜欢的角色和故事， 而不管你用的是AMD还是英伟达的显卡都能用，因为API可以和任何主流的显卡交流
-   you're still talking advantage of APIs all the time if you are in this time， API makes it easier for programs to do things like talk to your devices，modify your registry，use weluse screen elements like buttons and status bars，and much more，without making the developer code these things directly and also helping end-users by providing a more reliable，consistent experience.
-   如果你身处于这个时代，你总能用到API ，API能方便程序实现一些功能，像是与你的设备交流修改注册表，调用像按钮和状态栏之类的屏幕元素还有很多很多，开发者不用再自己开发这些功能，还能给使用者提供更可靠一致的体验
-    can you remeber imagine every single Windows program on your compauter has a different looking close button on the corner.
-   你还记得你电脑上的每个窗口程序右上角的关闭按钮长得都不一样
-   So while APIs might not be the usual star of the show when youftre doing whatever it is you do on your PC or phone，they make it possible for all of our disparate devices and enable the massive amounts of quick communication and high-end gaming that we've gotten used to do.
-   尽管当你使用电脑或者手机的时候，API的作用并不那么明显，他们能让你所有不同的设备为进行我们习以为常的大量快速通信，以及运行大型游戏创造可能
