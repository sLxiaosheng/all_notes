Lily:  闫慧            Mark:  华涛            Tom:  刘旻钞

Mark: hi，y，what are you doing at this special time?

Lily: emmm…..  In addition to online classes, I often keep my phone on. And sometimes I conduct programming exercises.

Mark: programming! oh!   This is almost the same as me.   I'm learning python recently.

Lily: I'm learning Java. the java API.

Mark: API?  What`s that?

**L: hi! Mark  and  Lily ! Met with my friends again! what are you talking about?**

Mark: hi!  L !   We are talking about API topics.  But I don’t  understand.   What’s that?

Lily: yes.   I'm learning Java API  recently.  it’s  very elegant(精美).

**Tom:  So, what do you think about it?**

Lily： Java  API is  this programmming language functions in fact.

Mark:  like “print”  function in C language?

Lily:  you are right.   It is divided into two types. one is Java built-in functions. another is functions we wrote and definit.

Mark:   oh! I understand. It is the same as function in Java.  when calling a function,  We don't need to understand how it works internally,  Only need to enter parameters or do not enter.

Lily:   great!  You now have a complete grasp of the API.

**Tom:    complete?   no, This is not all.**

Lily:     Is there anything else?

**L:    We only talked about a small part of it.  The full name of API is application programming interface.   it’s very important like the  middle man or lady actually  in computer-land.**

Mark:   Are you saying that API is common in the computer field?

Lily:   I'm afraid it's not just in it.

**Tom:  Yes. We all know. the software that we use  can be thought of as  sandwich-like stack of different programs. Some of which sit between whatever program you’re interacting`/ˌɪntə'rækt/` with directly`/də'rɛkt/` and the hardware itself.**

Mark:  I got it. it is  like the glue between the two.

Lily:  Me, too. without these layers, programmers and developers would have to code differently for every single hardware configuration on the plant. So, for protecting the apes in the crowd, it is necessary.

**Tom:  you are clever.  And other layers`/'lɛr/` sit between two different pieces of other software and help them talk to each other without needing to have tons`/tʌn/` of code in common.**

Lily:   By API, that programs can interface with lots of different device easily.

Mark:  I think it like device driver  it can “translates” program instructions and talks directly to your hardware.

**Tom: And another layer called an application programming interface, or API.**

Lily: But if a driver is already there then to serve as the link between your hardware and programs, then what does the APO actually do?

**Tom: Well, think of it like this,  Windows Mac OS and Linux all provide a graphical`/'ɡræfɪkl/  `  interface your buttons`/'bʌtn/`, checkboxes(复选框), menus, etc that are easy to click on.**

Mark:  Without that, you`d be left tediously typing commands for everything you want to do, like back in the days when DOS ruled the world. It can be more beautiful.

**Tom:  So, an API provides a simpler way for developers to interact with other kinds of software.**

Lily:   for example, there is social media plugins(插件) you see on certain websites，such as a news article that embeds weibo，these social media giants like QQ, twitter, facebook have their own APIs that they make available to web developers making it easy for them to bake their features into the pages.

Mark:  Without these APIs，these social media giants would have to share code directly with owners of other sites which would be tedious，difficult，and possibly give away certain trade secrets！

**Tom:  it’s funny! you're still talking advantage of APIs all the time if you are in this time， API makes it easier for programs to do things like talk to your devices`/dɪ'vaɪs/`, use welcome screen`/skrin/` elements`/ˈɛləmənt/` like buttons and status`/'stetəs/` bars，and much more，without making the developer code these things directly and also helping end-users by providing a more reliable，consistent`/kən'sɪstənt/` experience`/ɪk'spɪrɪəns/`.**

Lily:   can you remeber imagine every single Windows program on your computer has a different looking close button on the corner.

Mark:   In a sense, our body is also an API.  You see, we move our body, think ourself. we don’t need to understand how the brain directs our bodies.  just do it as usual.

**Tom:  Oh!   It is a good opinion`/ə'pɪnjən/`.**

Lily:  It’s time now. I should go home and  discuss with API.

**Tom, Mark:  Me,too.**
